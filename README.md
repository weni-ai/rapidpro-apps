You need configure the following envireoment variable `Necessary for some installations methods`
- `RAPIDPRO_APPS_PATH` - indicates the path where the repository was cloned
```sh
$ export RAPIDPRO_APPS_PATH="<path>"
```
**OBS**: from now on it is **very important** that it is inside your virtualenv  

After **activating your virtualenv** enter the weni-rp-apps directory
```sh
$ cd $RAPIDPRO_APPS_PATH
```
Run the `install` file
```sh
$ ./install
```

If an error occurs during the installation, the following error will be raised: `There was a problem during the installation`. On the other hand if everything goes well you will receive the following message `Package installed successfully`.
